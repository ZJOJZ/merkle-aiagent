1. Go to the ‘Profile’ page and click the ‘Referrals’ tab.
2. Click the referral url to copy the url.\
   Your link will look like this: `https://app.merkle.trade?ref=ABCDEFGH`

You can share your referral link over any social platform like X, Telegram, Reddit, etc.

You can track the trading activities and rebate history of those you've referred in the ‘Rebates History’ section, located at the bottom of the page.

## Earning Fee Rebates

You earn a fee rebate whenever your referred users make trades. This rebate is valid for 365 days since the user registers you as their referrer. This rebate is a percentage of the entry/exit fees and is credited in USDC. Rebates can be claimed anytime from the Referrals page.

The standard rebate rate starts at 5% of the entry/exit fees and can increase linearly up to 10%, based on your referees' trading volume between $1M and $5M during each 2-week epoch (aligned with Trading Seasons). Your rebate rate for the next epoch is determined by the total referee trading volume in the current epoch.

For example, if your referees' total trading volume is $3M in the current epoch, your rebate rate for the next epoch will be 7.5% (calculated as 5% + 5% × ($3M - $1M) ÷ ($5M - $1M)).

_Note: Trading volume from forex pairs is counted at 20% of its actual value._
