# Position Management

## Add Collateral

When you add collateral to an active position, the amount you provide with the _add collateral_ order will be added to your current position. This feature can be helpful if you want to lower your leverage or avoid being liquidated.&#x20;

## Update SL / TP&#x20;

Both stop-loss (SL) and take-profit (TP) prices can be updated for active positions. When updating, ensure that both prices are set to the desired values as they will be updated simultaneously.

## Position Close / Partial Close

You can close your position and receive the position value in a stablecoin (collateral + PnL - fees).

You can also choose to partially close a position by specifying the portion of the position size you would like to close. When you select the "Keep Leverage" option, a amount of collateral will be returned to maintain the same leverage level for the remaining position.
